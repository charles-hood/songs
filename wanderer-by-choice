## Wanderer by Choice

*Verse 1*
In a small dusty town, where the wind's always blowin'
There's an old man with eyes, full of stories and pain
He's seen all the chaos, all the follies and greed
Now he's had enough, it's time for him to be free

*Chorus*
He's a wanderer by choice, embracing the desert's voice
Leaving it all behind, finding solace in the sands
With each step he takes, the weight of the world fades
In the Americana style, he's found his promised land

*Verse 2*
With a worn-out guitar and a heart full of sorrow
He strums through the night under the starry skies
He sings of freedom, of redemption and hope
For every lost soul, searching for a way to cope

*Chorus*
He's a wanderer by choice, embracing the desert's voice
Leaving it all behind, finding solace in the sands
With each step he takes, the weight of the world fades
In the Americana style, he's found his promised land

*Bridge*
No more crowded streets, no more city lights
Just the howling wind and the moon as his guide
He's traded in the chaos for the calm of the dunes
Living his life under the wide-open skies, he's never been so alive

*Verse 3*
The townsfolk say he's lost, maybe gone astray
But he's found his purpose, in the desert's gentle sway
He's learned to love the solitude, the vastness and space
In the quiet of the desert, he's found his saving grace

*Chorus*
He's a wanderer by choice, embracing the desert's voice
Leaving it all behind, finding solace in the sands
With each step he takes, the weight of the world fades
In the Americana style, he's found his promised land

*Outro*
So if you see him passing, don't pity his soul
For he's found his heaven in a world he calls his own
He's the old man fed up with the world's endless noise
Embracing the desert, he's the wanderer by choice.
